Playing around with python and language technology (parsers etc.).


Parser based on Stephen Pinkers book The Language Instinct
----------------------------------------------------------

Run the parser: `./pinker_parser.py "The dog likes ice_cream"` or (`python pinker_parser.py "The dog likes ice_cream"` if you are on Windows)

Show the vocabulary: `./pinker_parser.py help` (or `python pinker_parser.py help` if you are on Windows)

Run the tests: `python test_pinker_parser.py`

The parser will just exit if you feed with a sentence it does not understand.
